<h1>About Me</h1>

  Government is Ndokwa West, Delta State. In my family, we are 7 in number which consist of My Parents, 2 boys 
  and 3 Girls.

  of being a first born.

<p> So i have alot of Goals and Hobbies, But I will start will my hobbies first of all. So i Love reading, writing, creating,
  drawing, playing Football and Basketball, More on basketball because it makes all burdens go away for a little while when 
  i step into the court to play basketball and in a way it relieves from overthinking and trust me, I can shoot a three to 
  save a life LOL. So people that ask why i love playing basketball, Here you have it LOL
  My Goals going into October is to perfect the little coding teachings and class to the point where i can get creating Websites
  for companies and organizations, Yes it's a Challenge and it's not going to be easy along the road but I am determined and 
  motivated and I got alot of people believing in me so i can't fail. Thanks to my bro and my namesake for being like a big brother
  to me and also and my Twin sister Doctor Kim for all the love and support.
